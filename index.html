        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">My hobby is to read fantasy, fiction, sci-fi, and comical novels in my free time. When I have free time during school, after school, or even before school I like to read thise books. I am 11 years old and also in the 6th grade, the first year of middle school. A few years back I learned how good reading is for, even if its for school or not. For me I've always had a love for books, my friends also read books but they started doing it for fun a few months later than I did in 1nd grade. In my opinion, reading boos can help me develope good skills and patience for my great life ahead. Also, most importantly, it helps me transform into a mature adult.
